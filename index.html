    <h1>Michael Agunga</h1>

    <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>I am a self-taught software developer looking to make a career change from Technical 
            Recruiting into an entry-level development position. I have spent over 3 years learning development - including college coursework and online boot camps. I have extensive academic experience with in-demand object-oriented languages like Python, 
            JavaScript, and SQL. I have a basic understanding of Algorithms and Data Structure concepts including Big O, Logarithm Complexity Levels, Arrays, Linked Lists, and Hash Tables. I have previous work experience as a Technical Recruiter where I have 
            gained a broad understanding of the IT industry including client business domains, systems, and strategies. In my past career, I have a verifiable track record of being a high performer and communicating effectively with business and technical stakeholders.
